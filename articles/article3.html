  <p>
    Many people rely solely on motivation to start a task, but motivation is fleeting. Consistency, 
    however, builds long-term results because it is based on repeated action, not temporary feeling.

  <h2>The Power of Small Daily Steps</h2>
  <p>
    Doing a little each day compounds into big results over time. Whether it’s learning a new skill, 
    exercising, or writing, consistent effort ensures progress even on days when motivation is low.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Build Consistency</h2>
  <p>
    Start by creating a routine with realistic, small goals. Track your progress and make it automatic. 
    Consistency creates habits that eventually feel natural and effortless.
