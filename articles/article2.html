  <p>
    A well-structured morning routine can dramatically increase focus, energy, and productivity. 
    Starting the day intentionally sets the tone for success.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Elements of a Focused Morning</h2>
  <p>
    Include light exercise, healthy breakfast, hydration, and 10–15 minutes of planning. 
    Avoid immediately checking your phone or emails — they create stress and distraction.
  </p>

  <h2>Benefits Over Time</h2>
  <p>
    Following a consistent routine improves mental clarity, reduces anxiety, and makes you more efficient. 
    Small adjustments in the morning can compound into big results in your personal and professional life.
